## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-27

Initial release for the Claude Opus 4.7 Hackathon 2026.

### Added
- **Cross-platform desktop app** built on Tauri 2, SvelteKit, Svelte 5 (runes), TypeScript, and Rust
- **Device discovery** with USB VID/PID classification (Arduino, FTDI, CH340, CP210x, generic USB serial, Bluetooth serial)
- **Live serial monitor** with ASCII + HEX views, timestamp, direction marker, and 1000-line ring buffer
- **Protocol Detective** — one-shot analysis powered by Claude Opus 4.7:
  - Structured JSON output with protocol name, confidence %, extracted fields, and command presets
  - Prompt caching on system prompt for ~70% cost reduction on repeat calls
  - Adaptive extended thinking for unknown / low-confidence cases
- **Agentic Investigation mode** — multi-step tool use:
  - `read_more_lines` — fetch recent samples
  - `search_pattern` — test ECMAScript regex hypotheses (ReDoS-guarded)
  - `analyze_binary_structure` — autocorrelate frame length, validate Modbus CRC16, count framing bytes
  - `get_device_metadata` — cross-reference USB descriptor fields
  - `probe_baud_rate` — test an alternate baud when data looks unprintable
  - `send_bytes` — transmit to the device to elicit responses
  - Live trace UI streams every thinking block, tool call, and result
- **Live Structured Dashboard** with sparklines
  - ASCII protocols: regex-based field extraction from `line.ascii`
  - Binary protocols: `match_hex` mode with `hex_u16_be` / `hex_u16_le` / `hex_s16_be` / `hex_u8` data types for fixed-offset extraction
  - Orange-themed cards distinguish binary-decoded fields from ASCII numbers
  - Stale indicator, value flash, per-field "last updated" timestamps
- **Device Profile Learning**
  - Every analysis with confidence ≥ 55% is persisted by `VID:PID:SerialNumber`
  - Reconnecting a learned device instantly populates the dashboard with zero API calls
  - `⭐ Auto-recognized` badge with session count
- **Bidirectional Communication**
  - Command Sender panel with ASCII (supports `\r \n \xNN` escapes) or HEX input
  - Claude-generated command presets appear as clickable chips per identified protocol
- **Cloud Bridge** — webhook forwarding
  - Per-device URL, method (POST/PUT/PATCH), throttle, and custom headers
  - `Test` button exercises the endpoint with a sample payload before enabling
  - HTTP/HTTPS URL validation; no SSRF guards (trusted desktop app)
- **CSV / JSON Export** — download the raw or structured stream for offline analysis
- **Demo Mode** (no hardware needed)
  - `⚖️ CAS Weighing Scale` — ASCII with stability flag (4 Hz)
  - `🛰️ GPS Receiver` — NMEA 0183 sentences with correct XOR checksums (1 Hz)
  - `🌡️ Arduino Sensor Array` — key=value CSV (2 Hz)
  - `🏭 Modbus RTU PLC` — binary frames with valid CRC16-IBM, 10 registers (1.7 Hz)

### Security
- API key storage via `@tauri-apps/plugin-store` (scoped to Tauri's app data directory)
- `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env fallback restricted to `import.meta.env.DEV` — release builds never embed the developer's key
- ReDoS guards reject regex patterns with nested quantifiers (`(a+)+`, `(a*)*`, etc.) and patterns over 300 characters
- Webhook URLs must use `http://` or `https://` protocol
- `send_bytes` tool capped at 256 bytes per call and requires an active monitor

### Developer experience
- 29 vitest unit tests covering parser, webhook URL validation, and the binary-analysis tool
- GitHub Actions CI: frontend (typecheck + tests + Vite build) and Rust (fmt + clippy + check)
- 0 TypeScript errors, 0 Svelte warnings on the full tree
- `friendlyError()` helper normalizes Anthropic SDK errors into short readable messages (401 → "API key rejected", 429 → "Rate limit hit", etc.)

### Documentation
